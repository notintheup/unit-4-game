# unit-4-game
Instructions
User is given a random number at the start of the game as a target to land on. 
There are four crystal balls displayed on the screen with random hidden values assigned to each. 
The user's goal is to try and match the random target score displayed to the current total.

You lose the game when you go above and beyond the target score. The game clears your current score and randomizes the target score all over. 

You win the game when your current score is exactly the same as the target score.
